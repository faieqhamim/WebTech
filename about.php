	    <span style="font-family:verdana;color:white" ><br>We often face a problem when we 
		travel one place to another place. maybe 
		it was a family tour, picnic or important 
		journey by our own car or rent car. 
		Whatever, suddenly in the middle of 
		journey there caught some major problem 
		in our car. Maybe it is an engine problem, 
		engine back fires or bikes tire punchures or 
		anything else and we stuck. In that moment we 
		need to fix up the car but we don't know where 
		the garage or we don't know whether there is any 
		garage around us or not. So it will be big 
		problem to get help or fix the problem for the 
		owner in the middle of the road. The problem will 
		be much bigger if the problems arise in the highway 
		roads with no people in one mile every direction. Then 
		there will be no choice for the owner to push the car for 
		miles even then he would not know the destination for the 
		nearest garage. Our application focuses to solve this kind 
		problem using the help of the internet and the messaging 
		service. The owner can very easily contact the app authority 
		through the app and describe the problem athe authonty will 
		find the nearest garage using GPS and tell the manager of the 
		garage to send a mechanic. Even if there are no internet sevices 
		in that area, the car owner can take the help of messaging service. 
		Through our app we are looking to ease the lives of people by solving 
		their car of vehicle issues that might arise in any moment of the day 
		or night. Otherwise it will be hard for working class people to do their 
		work and perform important tasks.</span>
